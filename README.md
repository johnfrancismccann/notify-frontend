# Notify Frontend Implementation

[This](http://www.johnmccann.io/#notify) is a frontend html/css implementation
I created for the Notify psd theme originally designed by Michael Reimer from
[Best PSD Freebies](http://bestpsdfreebies.com). The psd file can be found on
[Graphic Burger](http://graphicburger.com/notify-psd-theme/). Many thanks for
the design, I think it looks awesome!

The html/css implementation can be viewed
[here](http://www.johnmccann.io/notify/) on my personal website.
